# Nelson Company P.C.

This is a WordPress site created for a local PDX tax company.

The only design provided was a partial home page design.

The theme is a fully custom theme hand coded by me. There were no other contributers to this project. I used Docker to develop this project locally and GoDaddy Business Hosting for staging.

The live website can be viewed here: https://nelsontax.com
